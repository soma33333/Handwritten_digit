# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project demonstrates a simple handwritten digit recognizer using a fully connected (dense) neural network implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network to classify images of handwritten digits. The network consists of a single fully connected layer with 10 output neurons, corresponding to the 10 digit classes. 

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used for training and evaluation. It contains:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images of handwritten digits.
